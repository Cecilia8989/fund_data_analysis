## Description

This repository contain a project which aim is to investigate the prevalence of physical/sexual violence among women within a sample group of 500 individuals, focusing on incidents occurring within a 5-year period from either a current or former partner. The significance of understanding and addressing this phenomenon cannot be overstated, given that it is estimated that 1 in 3 women experience physical and/or sexual violence at some point in their lives.

The analysis will specifically explore four key variables: Level of education, region of residence, occupational level, and marital status. By examining and combining these variables, the goal is to calculate the likelihood of a woman, who is the subject of observation, having experienced violence in the last 5 years.
