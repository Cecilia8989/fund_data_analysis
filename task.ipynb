    "A good way to visualize a categorical-nominal variable is count the observations for each categories. The following code calculates the counts and normalized counts (rounded to two decimal places as percentages) of unique values in the 'Species' column of the DataFrame **df** using the **value_counts()** function [[28]](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/categorical-data), [[29]](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.value_counts.html) . It then combines these values into a DataFrame with columns **Count** and **%**."
